### Description
Add a short description here
### Why is this needed?
The research job must have a reason to be implemented. Include that here.
### Man hours.
Each research task must **at most** take x amount of hours to complete. If x hours has been exceeded, consider the research done and the job done. This section can be omitted and use the title instead. Example of this could be [1T30M] (1 hour and 30 minutes.)
